# CPX-sound-and-temp-meter
Use the switch to swap between temperature meter and sound meter on a Circuit Playground Express

Set the onboard switch to true for a temperature meter where the neopixwla grow or shrink color wise depending on how hot the room is

Set the switch to false for a fun VU sound meter using the neopixels

Both output probably too much to the serial monitor but also graphs things to the plotter :)
